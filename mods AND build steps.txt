Hi guys,
This works fine for me. Just get into the node-modules, and move into the browser.js file and change

node: false,

for

node: {crypto: true, stream: true},

node_modules/angular-devkit/build-angular/src/angular-cli-files/models/webpack-configs/browser.js

-----------------------------

https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner/issues/418

I had to remove inside ..\plugins\phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner\plugin.xml the

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera">
then removed and added again android platform.
Worked very fine for me.

-----------------------------

Error:All flavors must now belong to a named flavor dimension.

Open Platforms>android>cordova-plugin-ionic4-crosswalk-webview OR in the plugins folder for it to be permanent!!!

add, in the node:

android {
flavorDimensions "default"



2021/12/21: With the original Xwalk lib, we could not compile against api 29, because Android 10 Would crash.
So I found a solution and mashed up, again, the lib for all architectures, based on:
https://github.com/ks32/CrosswalkNative at version 77 of chromium, wich is even better than the old 53.

armeabi == armv7 == x86 -> SAME LIBS

arm64 == x86_64 --> SAME LIBS

armeabi/armv7/x86 apks are actually all the same, (they are a multi-arch APK for 32bit). arm64 & x86_64 likewise are also the same.


So you only need to upload arm64's APK & armv7's APK to the play store. Not all 5.



Modified xwalk.gradle or service-xwalk.gradle (when it's insideplatforms


cdvPluginPostBuildExtras.add({
   /* def xwalkMavenRepo = 'https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk/android/maven2';
    if (xwalkMode == LITE_MODE) {
        xwalkMavenRepo = 'https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-lite/android/maven2';
    }*/
    repositories {
      flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
      }
    }

    android {

    flavorDimensions "default"

        if (xwalk64bit != null) {
            productFlavors {
            // Building all together
                x86_64 {
                    versionCode defaultConfig.versionCode + 6
                    ndk {
                       abiFilters "x86_64", "x86", "arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a"
                    }
                }
               /* arm64 {
                    versionCode defaultConfig.versionCode + 9
                    ndk {
                        abiFilters "arm64-v8a", ""
                    }
                }*/
            }
        }
    }



AFTER CREATING THE APK:

Execute

cd platforms/android/

gradlew.bat bundle
